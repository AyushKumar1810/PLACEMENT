# Problem Statement: Given two numbers N and M, find the Nth root of M. The nth root of a number M is defined as a number X when raised to the power N equals M. If the â€˜nth root is not an integer, return -1.

# Examples
# Example 1:
# Input Format: N = 3, M = 27
# Result: 3
# Explanation: The cube root of 27 is equal to 3.

# Example 2:
# Input Format: N = 4, M = 69
# Result: -1
# Explanation: The 4th root of 69 does not exist. So, the answer is -1.
