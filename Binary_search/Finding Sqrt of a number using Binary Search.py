# Problem Statement: You are given a positive integer n. Your task is to find and return its square root. If ‘n’ is not a perfect square, then return the floor value of ‘sqrt(n)’.

# Note: The question explicitly states that if the given number, n, is not a perfect square, our objective is to find the maximum number, x, such that x squared is less than or equal to n (x*x <= n). In other words, we need to determine the floor value of the square root of n.

# Examples
# Example 1:
# Input Format: n = 36
# Result: 6
# Explanation: 6 is the square root of 36.

# Example 2:
# Input Format: n = 28
# Result: 5
# Explanation: Square root of 28 is approximately 5.292. So, the floor value will be 5

#we will use binary search
