1)A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree. Generally, Heaps can be of two types:

Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.

Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree. 

2) For identifying the Question is of Heaps , Two Point Always includes :
2.a) In question The keywords Includes "K " 
2.b) Im questions The keywords Includes " Smallest or Largest "  " Top or closest"
If In any Question these two includes then definetly we have to use "Heap"

3) Which Heap To choose ?? 
3.a) If in questions it's mentioned keywords "k" and "Smallest" then we have to Use "Max Heap " property , vice versa ..
3.b)If in questions it's mentioned keywords "k" and "Largest" then we have to Use "Min Heap " property , vice versa ..
4) what we have to do ?
Ans) Basically it’s just a sorting of O(nlog(n)) but using Heap it Makes O(nlog(k))
5) In Largest / greatest / Top We have to use Min Heap Property 
6) In Smallest /lowest / closest We have to use Max Heap Property
