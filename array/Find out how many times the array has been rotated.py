# Problem Statement: Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values). Now the array is rotated between 1 to N times which is unknown. Find how many times the array has been rotated. 



# Examples
# Example 1:
# Input Format: arr = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2,3]
# Result: 4
# Explanation: The original array should be [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. So, we can notice that the array has been rotated 4 times.

# Example 2:
# Input Format: arr = [3,4,5,1,2]
# Result: 3
# Explanation: The original array should be [1,2,3,4,5]. So, we can notice that the array has been rotated 3 times.
