# You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

# The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

# Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.



# Example 1:


# Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
# Example 2:

# Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
# Output: 0

#Here's the approach:

# Initialize a variable max_area to keep track of the maximum area found.
# Iterate through each cell in the grid:
# If the cell value is 1, initiate a DFS from that cell to explore the island.
# During DFS, mark visited cells with a value of 0 to avoid redundant exploration.
# Calculate the area of the island during DFS.
# Update max_area with the maximum of the current island's area and max_area.
# Return max_area as the result.
def maxAreaOfIsland(grid):
    def dfs(i, j):
        if i < 0 or i >= len(grid) or j < 0 or j >= len(grid[0]) or grid[i][j] == 0:
            return 0
        grid[i][j] = 0  # Mark the cell as visited
        area = 1  # Current cell contributes 1 to the area
        area += dfs(i + 1, j)  # Explore down
        area += dfs(i - 1, j)  # Explore up
        area += dfs(i, j + 1)  # Explore right
        area += dfs(i, j - 1)  # Explore left
        return area
    
    max_area = 0
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                max_area = max(max_area, dfs(i, j))
    
    return max_area

# Example usage:
grid1 = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
         [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
         [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
         [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
         [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
         [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
         [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
         [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
print(maxAreaOfIsland(grid1))  # Output: 6

grid2 = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
print(maxAreaOfIsland(grid2))  # Output: 0
