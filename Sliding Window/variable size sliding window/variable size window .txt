1.In variable  size sliding window we have given array and sum and we have to find The largest sub array with respect to given sum .
2.In varaible size sliding window instead of window size  , we will have given some condtion and we will have to find window size to maximize or minimize it ..

3.Pseudo Code:::

 while j < size of array :
        we will do some calculation to avaoid O(n^2) complexivity
    if condition < k :
        j=j+1 
    elif condition ==k :
        we will update the answer 
        j=j+1
    elif condition > k :
        while condition > k :
            remove calculation for i ( Here cuurent sum is greater than original sum then we have to increase i ,i++ , No only w ehave to incraese i we have to check sum in between i to j should not greater than original sum )
                i=i+1
        j=j+1
    return answer
